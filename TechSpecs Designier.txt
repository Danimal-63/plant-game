3 Days to program the individual tiles – create tile objects with different, sprite work and define what they do. (The table tile should be able to hold a placeableObject (Tech specs 3a), the sell table should take a placeableObject (a pot holding a plant, to be implemented later)and give back a reward, the mulch producer should produce a placeableObject (mulch, to be implemented later), different seed bags which will produce a placeableObject (seeds, to be implemented later), the watering fountain which will hold a placeableObject(emptyWaterBucket) and replace it with a different placeableObject( fullWaterBucket). Create empty tiles whose purpose is only to be walked on, and the potShed which produces a placeableObject (an empty pot)
1 Day to program the map – create the map object with a 2D array of tile objects. Develop a scalar for the size of the map to determine the spacing between tiles and tile size.
1 Day to program player– create a playerObject with sprite work with x and y coordinates that can be changed by pressing wasd and a separate second player that uses the arrow keys. The player should also have a direction implemented as the last direction they pressed. Player should not be able to pass over tiles that are not empty. Additionally create a score displaying how much money the player has.
2 days for the placeable objects, including programming the different types of plants and their rewards. Create at least 3 plant variants with different requirements (see tech specs 5 plants) and different maturityTimes. They should have different growth stages, which should be attained when maturity times are met, and different sprites for different growth stages. Creates Pots which can hold the plants to grow them. Create mulch which will be a requirement for plants. Create empty and full water buckets. Full water buckets will be a requirement for plants and be created when the empty water bucket is placed in the watering fountain.
2 days for interactions with the tiles objects. When the space bar is pressed, both players should check which tile is in front of them (look at the player’s position and increase it by the tile spacing in the direction the player is facing to determine which block should be interacted with. Make the tiles give and/or receive the placeableObjects laid out in the initial programming of the tiles. Make it a requirement that plants need a pot before they can be placed on a tile. When a plant is placed on the sell tile the player score is increased.
2 Days for customers – Create a section at the top of the screen to display the orders for plants which will show a bar of decreasing size. This should correlate directly to the rewardMultiplier laid out in Tech Specs 5 customers. When the plant specified is placed on the sell tile, the normal price is multiplied by the rewardMultiplier and gives the resulting amount to the player. When the rewardMultiplier reaches 0, the player should lose money.  Set up a score minimum to beat the level.
2 Days to design buyable tiles atm. Once a level is beat, the player should transition to separate screen in which they use their accumulated score to buy new tiles displayed similarly to the main tile screen. When the player interacts with a tile on this screen, score is removed from their object and the tile can be placed on the original screen by interacting with that tile.
1 day to work on the map expansion purchase in the shop and develop new tiles/objects to be sold
2 days of sprite art at the end
